## Models

The models are applicable for systems containing the following set of chemical elements:
{H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, As, Se, Br, I}, both neutral and charged. The models aim to reproduce RKS B97-3c and wB97M-D3 energies.
  
The models are in the form of JIT-compiled PyTorch-2.0 files and could be loaded in Python or C++ code.

Note, that at present models have O(N^2) compute and memory complexity w.r.t. number of atoms. They could be applied to systems up to a few 100's of atoms. Linear scaling models, with the same parametrization, will be released soon.

In Python, the models could be loaded with the `torch.jit.load` function. As an input, they accept single argument of type `Dict[str, Tensor]` with the following data:
```
coords: shape (m, n, 3) - atomic coordinates in Angstrom 
numbers: shape (m, n) - atomic numbers
charge: shape (m, ) - total charge
```
Output is a dictionary with the following keys:
```
energy: shape (m, ) - energy in eV
charges: shape (m, n) - partial atomic charges
```

## Installation
To make accessing the models simpler this package can be installed into a python environment. It is recommended that you
create a new conda environment with the required dependencies to run the AIMNET2 model and provided calculator interfaces.
 You can create the environment using the following command
```bash
mamba create -n aimnet2 -c conda-forge 'pytorch=2' numpy ase
```
you should then activate the environment using
```bash
conda activate aimnet2
```
to use the `pysisyphus` calculator you will need to install the package from PyPI using pip
```bash
pip install pysisyphus
```
you should then clone this package and install from source via
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isayevlab/AIMNet2.git
cd AIMNet2
pip install . 
```

## Loading models via python
The aimnet2 package provides a convenience function to load the ensemble models
```python
from aimnet2 import load_model
model = load_model("wb97m-d3") # can also load b973c
```
the model can then be used by providing the inputs as described in [Models](#models) or used with one of the provided 
calculators like ASE
```python
from aimnet2.calculators.aimnet2ase import AIMNet2Calculator

calculator = AIMNet2Calculator(model=model)
```


## Calculators

We provide example code for AIMNet2 calculators for [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase) and [pysisyphus](https://pysisyphus.readthedocs.io/) Python libraries. The code shows an example use of the AIMNet2 models. 

We also provide example geometry optimization scripts with ASE and Pysisyphus, and `pysis_mod` script which is a drop-in replacement for Pysisyphus `pysis` command-line utility, with AIMNet2 calculator enabled.

## Docker image

We provide an example Dockerfile to build a CPU docker image.

The commands for building docker image: 
```bash
cd /path/to/AIMNet2 
docker build --platform linux/amd64 --pull --rm -f "docker/Dockerfile_cpu" -t aimnet-box "."
```

You might skip the `--platform` flag if you are building on Linux.

The image exposes `aimnet2_ase_opt.py` script as entrypoint.

Example command to run geometry optimization with docker image:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app/ aimnet-box models/aimnet2_wb97m-d3_ens.jpt input.sdf output.sdf --charge 0 --traj output.traj
```

Use `ase convert output.traj output.xyz` for conversion to e.g. `xyz` file format.

### Feedback

We would appreciate it if you could share feedback about model accuracy and performance. This would be important not only for us, to guide further developments of the model, but for the broad community as well. 
Please share your thoughts and experience, either positive or negative, by opening an issue in this repo.
